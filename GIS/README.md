# GIS files


*10 May 2023*


This folder contains a backup of GIS shapefiles used in different guides. They have been modified or removed from official sources online. Until the guides are updated, you can use these files with the guides.

The following are available here:

## EU NUTS files

- Raw `NUTS_RG_03M_2021_3035_mainland.xxx` shapefile from Eurostat GISCO with islands cleaned up.
- The Stata versions of the above shapefiles for NUTS0, NUTS1, NUTS2, NUTS3.
- The `demo_r_pjanind3.dta` contains demographic data from Eurostat that can be merged with the NUTS files.


## Cartograms

- Stata files for a global cartogram: `world_cartogram.dta` and `world_cartogram_shp.dta`. Can be merged using `ISO3` country codes.
- Stata files for USA cartogram: `usa_cartogram.dta` and `usa_cartogram_shp.dta`. Can be merged using `FIPS` or 2-letter state codes.
